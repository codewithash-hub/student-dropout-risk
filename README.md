# 🎓 Predictive Analytics for Student Dropout Risk

This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of student dropouts based on key indicators such as **attendance**, **test scores**, and **engagement metrics**. The goal is to identify at-risk students early enough to enable timely interventions.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

* **Problem**: Educational institutions often struggle to detect dropout risks early.
* **Solution**: Apply classification models to predict student dropout likelihood.
* **Impact**: Model supports early warning systems for student retention.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Scikit-learn** for machine learning
* **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualizations
* **Jupyter Notebook** for development and presentation

---

## ✅ Features Implemented

* **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values and engineered features
* **Model Training**:

  * Logistic Regression
  * Decision Tree Classifier
* **Evaluation Metrics**:

  * Accuracy, Precision, Recall
  * Confusion Matrix
* **Visualizations**:

  * Feature importance
  * Model performance metrics

---

## 📊 Results

* Achieved **over 83% accuracy** in identifying at-risk students
* Useful for integrating into school dashboards or early warning systems
